Around the time of the dotcom burst of the the late 90â€™s many more people started pursuing careers in programming(coding). What was once a job behind a honking monitor with slacks, tie, and pens in the front pocket has become a hip job associated with people riding their bike through the offices at google, working remotely from home, and people at starbuckâ€™s coffee shops sipping on macchiatoâ€™s and latteâ€™s with  macbook proâ€™s pecking away at the keyboard.</h3>
