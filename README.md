# ericchrobak.com Portfolio
This is the portfolio website for Eric Chrobak. The was designed and developed by Eric Chrobak using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Ruby, and Jekyll.


## Motivation
After putting together some work for some online classes I decided to showcase my work. Using the skills I learned I put together this site to showcase work I've done with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Boostrap. From there I ended up learning Ruby and decided to migrate my site to [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com)

## Credits
This site was initially a static html page. The page was initially inspired from a project I had to do for [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com). From there I had done some work for an online course for Flatiron School. I had to create a blog that was on GitHub pages. That inspired me to migrate my website to GitHub Pages. This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
