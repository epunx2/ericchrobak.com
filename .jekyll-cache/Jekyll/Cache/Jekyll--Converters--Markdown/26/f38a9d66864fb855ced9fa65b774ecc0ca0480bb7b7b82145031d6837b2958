I"p<p>Computer programming/coding started out as the domain of “geeks”, “nerds”, and “hackers” from the 50’s up until the last 10-15 years. Around the time of the dotcom burst of the the late 90’s many more people started pursuing careers in programming(coding). What was once a job behind a honking monitor with slacks, tie, and pens in the front pocket has become a hip job associated with people riding their bike through the offices at google, working remotely from home, and people at starbuck’s coffee shops sipping on macchiato’s and latte’s with  macbook pro’s pecking away at the keyboard.</p>
