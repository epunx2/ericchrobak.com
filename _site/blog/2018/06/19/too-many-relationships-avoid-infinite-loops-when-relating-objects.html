        <h1>Too Many Relationships!? Avoid Infinite Loops When Relating Objects</h1>
        <p id="date">19 Jun 2018 - Eric Chrobak</p>
        <p>Do you have too many relationships? Does your app have to many relationships? Actually what I’m wondering is do you get stuck in a loop with bad relationship(s)? Well I’m sure we’ve all been there where you just cant seem to break out of a bad loop when relating classes to one another(not unlike dating relationships!)I like how coding relates to real life.</p>

<p>Recently while doing a project for the has many relationships I found myself continually getting stuck in loops when relating one object to another. I had an issue in the OO Tic Tac Toe project where I was stuck in an infinite loop and I didn’t resolve it but, moved on to a later test in the project. After several hours of debugging I asked a question on the ask a question forum. A tech coach suggested that I fix the loop first. After doing that it was much easier to debug the rest of my code.</p>

<p>While in the has many relationships lab I was doing the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Relating the Artist class to the Song class via add song method in Artist class.</li>
  <li>Then I was creating a new song if one wasn’t found.</li>
  <li>Then I was creating a new Artist for the song in the song class</li>
  <li>Then under that new artist class I added the song to the artist</li>
</ol>

<p>What happened for one of my tests at this point was {Artist, songs={song1{song name, artist={Artist , name, songs={song 1… so on and so forth endlessly adding a new artist and adding the song and looking for an artist and adding an artist.</p>

<p>I was’t sure what to do and remembered back to the OO Tic Tac Toe lab where the tech coaches recommended I fix my infinite loop first. So in the has many relationships lab I fixed my loop first.</p>

<p>So in the example I gave this is what would need to happen:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Artist class has: songs array, artist name, and add song method</li>
  <li>The add song method has argument of song name and creates new instance of song with self(the current instance of the artist) as the artist of the new song instance.</li>
  <li>The song class has: song name, artist name</li>
  <li>when a new song is created with an artist name or an artist name is added then you search the artist class variable @@all by name for the artist and if one isn’t found then create a new artist with the current instance of song added to the existing or new instance of artist. You don’t use the add a song method because that will create your infinite loop but rather you add the song to the songs array for the instance of Artist.</li>
</ol>

<p>Searching for the artist prevents you from creating a new artist. This process will work for for any simple relationship. For other classes change the names of the class and the necessary properties.</p>

<p>Cheers and happy relationships!</p>
