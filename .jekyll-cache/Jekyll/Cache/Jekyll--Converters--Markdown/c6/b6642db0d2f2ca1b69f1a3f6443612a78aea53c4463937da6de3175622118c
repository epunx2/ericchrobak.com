I"¹<p>Solving problems with programming is an open ended adventure. There are multiple ways to solve a problem, present an idea, or make something. My most frustrating experience thus far in coding was a project I had for an online coding program Iâ€™m doing with Flatiron School. My goal was to build an Object Oriented TIC TAC TOE game in the command line. I had already built one but there was a difference in what they wanted me to do.</p>
