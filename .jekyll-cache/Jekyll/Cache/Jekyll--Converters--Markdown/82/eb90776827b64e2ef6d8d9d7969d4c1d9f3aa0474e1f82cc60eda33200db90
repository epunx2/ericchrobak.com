I"t<p>Do you have too many relationships? Does your app have to many relationships? Actually what I’m wondering is do you get stuck in a loop with bad relationship(s)? Well I’m sure we’ve all been there where you just cant seem to break out of a bad loop when relating classes to one another(not unlike dating relationships!)I like how coding relates to real life.</p>
