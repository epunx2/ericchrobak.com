I"<p>I love that coding and programming involves shortcuts to increase productivity.</p>

<p>One of my favorite shortcuts while working on a computer is keyboard shorctus!</p>

<p>I will provide some common ones and then those more specific to Learn IDE.</p>

<p>CMD/⌘ - this is the Command/ button on the mac. PC users use your Ctrl(Control) key.
These are is located on the lower left of your keyboard.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
CMD + ; - press the CMD button and press the “;” key.
Don’t press the + key. I added that to separate the two keys visually.</p>

<h2 id="general-shortcuts">General Shortcuts</h2>

<p>CMD + Tab - switch between applications ex. switch between Learn IDE and Chrome.</p>

<p>CMD + C - Copy - copies the highlighted text, picture, folder, etc.</p>

<p>CMD + X - Cut - cuts the highlighted text, picture, folder, etc. The difference between this copy command is when you cut the highlighted item is removed until you paste it in the new location.</p>

<p>CMD + V - Paste - pastes what you either copies or cut onto the location your cursur is or in the folder you are in.</p>

<p>CMD + B - Bold - changes cursor  and/or highlighted text to bold.</p>

<p>CMD + I - Italics - changes cursor and/or highlighted text to italics.</p>

<p>CMD + U - Underline - changes cursor and/or  highlighted text to underlined.</p>

<p>CMD + ;  -  switch between text editor and console.</p>

<p>CMD + i - toggle the console on or off.</p>

<p>CMD + \ - will toggle the file tree on the left side.</p>

<p>CMD + / - will comment out the line your cursor is on and if you have mutliple lines hightlighted then CMD-/ will comment out all the lines you have highlighted.</p>

<p>CMD + 1 - if you have mutliple files open in the learn ide CMD-1 switches to the 1st file.</p>

<p>CMD + 2 - to the second, and so on.</p>

<p>The last two work in all web browsers to switch to the different tabs you have open.
