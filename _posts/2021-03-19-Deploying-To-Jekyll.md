This site was started in 2016 as part of a Codecademy project. At the time it was built on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery. It went through a series of changes from there. With the main one being a css theme being added for the nav menu.<br>
<br>
Over time I saw the maintenance of the site was becoming to much. Some of the things that were a big hindrance were:<br>
<br>
1. *Hosting fees* 
2. *Everytime I had to change the nav or footer I had to update each page* 
3. *Deploying changes was tedius and cumbersome.*<br><br>

I decided I needed to switch to something more scalable and cheaper. After comparing different options I settled on Jekyll and the GitHub Pages tandem. This provides you:<br>
<br>
- *A way to build templates for your website pages, nav, and footer to make changes site wide once*
- *Make it static*
- *Have free hosting*
- *Develop with Ruby*
- *Code it all from scratch*
- *Deploy changes when making a git push*<br><br>

The process I had to go through to get this up and running was rather long and intricate but I learned a lot of things and am now able to maintain it myself.
